Report on the Neural Network Model

1.Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to help the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
In other words, we have to predict if an Organisation will be successful in its venture based on the available data.

2.Results:

#Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
'IS_SUCCESSFUL' Column is choosen as the Target Variable.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION','USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' Columns are taken as Features for the Machine Learning Model.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
'EIN', 'NAME' are removed from the input data.

#Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
8+16+16 neral nodes were used and 3 hidden layers were used for the model. Relu is used as Activation Function for the Input Layer and Sigmoid is used for the Output Layer.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
The model was able to achieve only 72.7% Accuracy.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
An addition hidden layer was added and the number of Epochs were increased from 100 to 150 and the Activation function was changed to try increase the Performanve of the model.
